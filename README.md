## Changes in This Version

This version of PetClinic, consists in migrating the original version developed in a monolith architecture to a modular modulith one using the latest technology Spring Modulith.
After the migration, the application is divided in two versions, based on the type of inter-module communication used: synchronous or asynchronous.
In addition to these major changes, several minor modifications were made to the original PetClinic application:
  - Adjustments to the User Interface to minimize coupling.
  - Added two functionalities: Delete an Owner and Delete a Pet, to enable implementation and testing of inter-module communications.
